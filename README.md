This code is a Python script that generates and displays Power Ball numbers using the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). Let's break down the code:

Import Statements: The script imports the necessary modules, random for generating random numbers and tkinter for GUI.
Function generate_power_balls(): This function generates a set of five unique numbers between 1 and 69 (inclusive) for the white balls and a single number between 1 and 26 (inclusive) for the red ball. It returns a sorted list containing the white ball numbers followed by the red ball number.
Function display_power_balls(): This function creates a Tkinter window to display the Power Ball numbers. It first generates a set of Power Ball numbers using generate_power_balls(). Then, it creates labels for each number, with the first five labels having a white background and the last label (for the red ball) having a red background. It also creates a "Reroll" button that, when clicked, generates and displays a new set of Power Ball numbers.
Main Block: It checks if the script is run as the main program and if so, calls the display_power_balls() function.
Tkinter GUI Layout: The GUI layout consists of labels displaying the Power Ball numbers and a "Reroll" button to generate new numbers.

Overall, this script provides a simple graphical interface for generating and displaying Power Ball numbers, allowing users to reroll for new numbers with the click of a button.
